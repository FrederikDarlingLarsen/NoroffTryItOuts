//1. Using CodePen, write a program which creates two constants with the numeric values of 23 and 2 respectively

const aNumber = 23

const otherNumber = 2

//2. Apply all the arithmetic operator discussed previously to the two numbers and log the results to the console window. Note the results.

let adding = aNumber + otherNumber

let substracting = aNumber - otherNumber

let multiplying = aNumber * otherNumber

let division = aNumber / otherNumber

let modulo = aNumber % otherNumber
