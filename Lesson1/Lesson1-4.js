//1. Using CodePen write a program which determines whether a number is divisble by 5

//2. If the number is divisible by 5, the message "x is divisible by 5" should be display, with 'x' being replaced by the number.

//3. Conversely, if the number is NOT divisible by 5, the message "x is NOT divisible by 5" should be display, with 'x' being replaced by the number.
